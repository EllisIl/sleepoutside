What did I do since the last meeting?
Since the last meeting I reviewed over the broken cart card and discussed with my team 
about solutions and how figured out the problem in the javaScript coding.

What am I going to do next?
Prepare for week 3 and the next activities with the team and personal Trello Cards.

What are my blockers?
Blockers from this week were the difficulty with getting things downloaded and making sure 
gitHub was connecting my repositories to the correct branch.
